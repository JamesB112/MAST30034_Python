# Welcome to the MAST30034 Python Repo
- Author: [Akira Takihara Wang](https://github.com/akiratwang)
- Tutorial Up-to-Date as of: April 2021 (in progress) 
- Usage: For MAST30034 students only  

This repository will house all Python workshops and some extra stuff (for Windows users).

Please note that this subject is akin to the Computer Systems "IT Project" and there is a high expectation that students spend time learning additional tools and conducting quality research.

The R stream is available here (TBA).

**NOTE: This repository is still being constructed and updated from the 2020 content.**
