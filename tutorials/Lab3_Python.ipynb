The corresponding p-value of  this F statistic is `0.00`, which is less than $\\alpha=0.05$, so we can conclude that our fitted model is better than a null model.

    "- LASSO may cause coefficients to be set to 0 by constraining the model.\n",
    "- This is because we put a constraint where the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients must be less than some fixed value. \n",
    "- As such, some coefficients may end up having 0 which is the same as *dropping* the attribute from the model.\n",
    "- In this sense, it's quite similar to feature selection as you end up with a model that is much more simpler. \n",

    "Quick overview:\n",

    "- Aims to lower the scale of the coefficients to avoid overfitting, but does not result in coefficients being 0.\n",
    "- In contrast to LASSO, we put a constrain using the sum of squares that must be lest than a fixed value. \n",
    "- As you might guess, this means we still have several features making it less interpretable than LASSO.\n",
    "- However, Ridge Regression performs best in cases where there may be high multi-colinearity (i.e dependencies between attributes) or high linear correlation between certain attributes,\n",
    "- This is because it reduces variance in exchange for some more bias (consider variance-bias tradeoff).\n",
